/* 4)Task:
        Write a Java program that prints the name of the day of the week based on a given integer value.
        Step 1: Declare an integer variable named dayOfWeek.
        Step 2: Assign a value of 1 to the dayOfWeek variable.
        Step 3: Write an if statement that checks if the value of dayOfWeek is 1.
        Step 4: Inside the if statement, use the System.out.println() method to print the string "Monday".
        Step 5: Write an else if statement that checks if the value of dayOfWeek is 2.
        Step 6: Inside the else if statement, use the System.out.println() method to print the string "Tuesday".
        Step 7: Repeat steps 5 and 6 for the remaining days of the week (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday),
        using the appropriate integer values and string names.
        Step 8: Write an else statement that executes if none of the previous conditions are true.
        Step 9: Inside the else statement, use the System.out.println() method to print the string "Invalid day of week".
        Step 10: Save and run the program to see the output. */
