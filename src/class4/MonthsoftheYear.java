/* 5) Task: Write a Java program that prints the name of the month based on a given integer value.
   Step 1: Declare an integer variable named month.
   Step 2: Assign a value of 1 to the month variable.
   Step 3: Write an if statement that checks if the value of month is 1.
   Step 4: Inside the if statement, use the System.out.println() method to print the string "January".
   Step 5: Write an else if statement that checks if the value of month is 2.
   Step 6: Inside the else if statement, use the System.out.println() method to print the string "February".
   Step 7: Repeat steps 5 and 6 for the remaining months of the year (March through December),
   using the appropriate integer values and string names.
   Step 8: Write an else statement that executes if none of the previous conditions are true.
   Step 9: Inside the else statement, use the System.out.println() method to print the string "Invalid month".
   Step 10: Save and run the program to see the output.
